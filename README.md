# My-samples
These are samples Iâ€™ve made for making my admin life easier:

GET-VEEAMTAPESNEEDED.PS1
Figure out what tapes are needed this week and send that list out

LARD.PS1 
LAPS Admin Remote Desktop - facilitates LAPS RDP connections with GUI and credential lookup. 
Basically, if you have rights to look up the password in AD, then the LARD button turns green. 
If you don't have rights, it turns red. If green, you can click it to open up an RDS 
connection to that endpoint.

JOBMASTER.PS1
this script runs remote scripts in job form, on all computers in a windows domain OU
that you choose. 
First shows a form for you to pick an OU, and then choose a script to run. All 
scripts live in the \Jobs subfolder, and are listed in the form. Then when the 
job runs on the chosen OU, the final computer list is made of computers that
respond to pinging, and the results output back to grid view when they complete.

OLDFILECLEANUP.PS1 
Deletes old files based on number of days old
